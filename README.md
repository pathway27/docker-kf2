Dockerfile for running a Killing Floor 2 server

* GitHub: https://github.com/dwurf/docker-kf2
* Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/dwurf/docker-kf2/

Requirements
------------

2GB RAM and 20GB free disk space are essential. SSD recommended, otherwise map
changes will take a long time. Disk space requirements will keep going up as 
updates are released.

**RHEL Host Nodes**
------------
A couple of amendments specific to RHEL and any offshoots:

To allow an IPv4 address to be shared with containers on a RHEL host, you need to ensure that `net.ipv4.ip_forward` is enabled. This can be set using `sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`. Afterwards, you must restart docker `systemctl restart docker` or `service docker restart` depending on if you are using init.d or systemd.

With docker `-v` mounts you can add `:z` to the end of the mount argument to add the relevant SELinux contexts to use the bind mount automatically. For example `-v $HOME/kf2:/home/steam/kf2server` becomes `-v $HOME/kf2:/home/steam/kf2server:z`.


Compose Quickstart
------------------

```
mkdir -p {kf2_steamdir,kf2server}
docker-compose -f docker-compose-public.yml up -d
```

Simple start
------------

    mkdir -p $HOME/{kf2,kf2_steamdir}
    docker run -d -t --name kf2 -p 0.0.0.0:20560:20560/udp \
        -p 0.0.0.0:27015:27015/udp \
        -p 0.0.0.0:7777:7777/udp \
        -p 0.0.0.0:8080:8080 \
        -v $HOME/kf2:/home/steam/kf2server \
        -v $HOME/kf2_steamdir:/home/steam/steam \
        dwurf/docker-kf2:latest

Configuring the server
----------------------

Configuration is done via environment variables. To run a long, hard server:

    docker run -d -t --name kf2 -p 0.0.0.0:20560:20560/udp \
        -p 0.0.0.0:27015:27015/udp \
        -p 0.0.0.0:7777:7777/udp \
        -p 0.0.0.0:8080:8080 \
        -v $HOME/kf2:/home/steam/kf2server \
        -v $HOME/kf2_steamdir:/home/steam/steam \
        -e KF_DIFFICULTY=1 \
        -e KF_GAME_LENGTH=2 \
        dwurf/docker-kf2:latest

Updating the server
-------------------

Run with the command `update`

    docker run -d -t --name kf2 -p 0.0.0.0:20560:20560/udp \
        -p 0.0.0.0:27015:27015/udp \
        -p 0.0.0.0:7777:7777/udp \
        -p 0.0.0.0:8080:8080 \
        -v $HOME/kf2:/home/steam/kf2server \
        -v $HOME/kf2_steamdir:/home/steam/steam \
        dwurf/docker-kf2:latest \
        update

Further arguments get passed to the update command, e.g.

    docker run -d -t --name kf2 -p 0.0.0.0:20560:20560/udp \
        -p 0.0.0.0:27015:27015/udp \
        -p 0.0.0.0:7777:7777/udp \
        -p 0.0.0.0:8080:8080 \
        -v $HOME/kf2:/home/steam/kf2server \
        -v $HOME/kf2_steamdir:/home/steam/steam \
        dwurf/docker-kf2:latest \
        update -beta preview validate

**NOTE:** Special characters are anything that `sed` considers special, so /, ^, \, * etc. To escape the character, prepend \ before it as in the examples provided in the compose files and above.


Running multiple servers
------------------------

1. Ensure 'command' in docker-compose.yml is not present. Updates will be
   handled from the first server only.
2. Change ports (increment), set environment variables to match
3. Change server name (optional)

Update the volume mounts as follows:

Map the following read-only volume from server 1

 - $HOME/kf2:/home/steam/kf2server:ro \

Map the following read-write volumes

 - $HOME/kf2-server2/steam/:/home/steam/steam
 - $HOME/kf2-server2/kf2server/KFGame/Logs:/home/steam/kf2server/KFGame/Logs
 - $HOME/kf2-server2/kf2server/KFGame/Config:/home/steam/kf2server/KFGame/Config

These are only required for Steam Workshop maps (see below)

 - $HOME/kf2-server2/kf2server/Binaries/Win64/steamapps:/home/steam/kf2server/Binaries/Win64/steamapps
 - $HOME/kf2-server2/kf2server/KFGame/Cache:/home/steam/kf2server/KFGame/Cache

You *must* also copy the basic config files from server1

    mkdir -p $HOME/kf2-server2/kf2server/KFGame/Config
    cp -a $HOME/kf2/kf2server/KFGame/Config/* $HOME/kf2-server2/kf2server/KFGame/Config

Steam Workshop maps
-------------------

Find the map you wish to use on the Steam workshop, for example [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1551913612][]. Note the ID argument from the URL (1551913612) and the name of the map (KF-NachtDerUntoten_TraderPod) and add this to a `game.yml` file in the root directory using the `custommaps` property, like so:

```
custommaps:
  - name: "KF-NachtDerUntoten_TraderPod",
    steamworksids:
      - 1551913612
```

At runtime, the configuration files will be written and will include the map alongside the defaults. A number of things are possible to set for each map added. These are listed below:

| Property             | Default                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |

| steamworksids        | N/A                                         | Must be set in order to download the map at runtime. An array of IDs provided to the KFEngine ini file to download the relevant map. This can be set to multiple things for accessibility. |
| mapfilename          | `name`                                      | The name of the file used for the KFMapSummary section mapname. Can be set differently for accessibility.                                                                                  |

TODO
----

* Add support for running multiple KF2 servers from the one directory
* Map logs and config to another volume(s)
* This is docker, we shouldn't need logs (use `docker logs`) and config should be done via env variables (i.e. move the config file outside of the volume but it doesn't need to be exposed)
* See also ConfigSubDir under https://wiki.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)#Command_Line_Launch_Options
